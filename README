Flang Host Build Scripts for Termux
===================================

A makefile to build flang-new binaries for compiling Termux packages
using the termux-packages build infrastructure


Just call `make` and the resulting bin.tar.gz contains builds for both
32 and 64 bit versions of Android. The termux build scripts use the 
flang-new wrapper driver to avoid issues with the output of the compilers

Both 32 and 64 bit versions are used as patches which enable 32 bit 
versions of flang to compile also affect the binaries which the resulting
flang compiler creates.
